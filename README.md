> [!NOTE]  
> I am Lucas and I love to work on any development project. I like to discover new technologies and frameworks. I also like to think about different issues and solve them. What's more, I really like to think about how to structure things, like thinking about the database infrastructure or how to write my code cleanly using `SOLID` principles or `design patterns`.

The languages and frameworks I work with every day:

- PHP
- Laravel
- Symfony
- Sylius
- Node
- Vue
- Next
- Inertia
- Livewire
- Typescript

The tools I use to set up my everyday environment:

- Docker
- Laravel Herd
- Homebrew
