> I am Lucas and I love to work on any development project. I am a full-stack developer. I like to discover new technologies and frameworks. I also like to think about different issues and solve them. What's more, I really like to think about how to structure things, like thinking about the database infrastructure or how to write my code cleanly using `SOLID` principles or `design patterns`.

The languages|frameworks I work with every day, whether at work or on a side project:
- 🐘 Laravel, Symfony, PHP, Sylius
- 🌐 Node.js, Vue.JS, React.js, Inertia.js, Typescript, Livewire, Next.js

The tools I use to set up my everyday environment:
- Docker
- Laravel Herd

My strong interests:
- 🎽 Sport: Basket-ball, Handball, Hiking
